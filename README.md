## What I Learned
I have completed the "News Homepage" challenge from the Frontend Mentor platform. This project aimed to improve the design of the news site homepage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used techniques such as CSS flexbox and media queries to create a comprehensive responsive design and user-friendly interface. I also added menu interaction and scrolling using JavaScript. While developing the project, I paid attention to a modular structure and clean coding principles.
